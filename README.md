# Benchmarking Multi-Scenes Fire and Smoke Detection
This repository is the official implementation of our paper titled " Benchmarking Multi-Scenes Fire and Smoke Detection" It includes the Multi-Scenes Fire and Smoke Detection (FSD) Bencharmk，five kinds of previous FSD Datasets，and a new testing set from these datasets (testing sets) we used. We reprocessed the previous FSD datasets and unified the format of the labels for all datasets so that people can use them easily. The repository will be made available until it is accepted.
